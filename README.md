# 🌊 Rhythmé  

Welcome to the evolving journey of **Rhythmé** — a *Personal Alignment System* designed to bring harmony between your productivity, focus, and well-being.  

Rhythmé is more than a productivity app. It’s a **unified ecosystem** that helps users manage their **habits, focus, and reflections** in one intelligent flow — learning from their behavior to help them grow with balance and clarity.  

Our mission is to bridge the gap between **discipline and mindfulness**, building tools that don’t just track progress, but nurture purpose.

- Journal their thoughts and reflections  
- Use a focus timer to manage deep work sessions  

This phase lays the groundwork for future features like:  
- Personalized AI insights  
- Sentiment analysis of journals  
- Predictive habit success scores  
- Goal alignment and recommendations
