<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

# RhythmÃ©  

Welcome to **Day One** of *RhythmÃ©*.  

RhythmÃ© is not just another productivity appâ€”it is being built to **solve the real problem of fragmented tools** and their failure to consider the **mental and emotional side of productivity**.  

Our mission is to create a **unified productivity ecosystem** where habits, journaling, and focus come together, supported by intelligent insights that adapt to the userâ€™s state of mind.  

This is just the beginning. The code you see here today may be small, but it marks the first step toward something much bigger.
